# 🐱✨ Scratch Helper

## 📘 Introduction

Welcome to **Scratch Helper**, your friendly A.I. Copilot for Scratch! This tool is designed with young learners in mind, offering guidance and support to help kids explore and master Scratch, a popular visual programming language. Currently in its beta phase, I'm eager to hear your feedback and bug reports to enhance its functionality.

Why spend countless hours watching video tutorials just to understand a simple block in Scratch? With **Scratch Helper**, you can quickly get the assistance you need, making your learning journey smoother and more enjoyable.

## 🚀 How to Use Scratch Helper

Using Scratch Helper is a breeze! Simply click on the link provided on the right side of the screen or tap on the link below to get started. Our tool is ready to guide you through your Scratch projects, making learning interactive and fun.

1. Press the blue extension button in the bottom left corner.
2. Click on your extension.
3. Another category will be added called "scratch-tutor", with a single block reading "Enter sprite index (starting from 1) [SpriteIdx] and OpenAI API key [UsersApiKey]". You can press on the block itself or drag it out into the workspace, and have an event trigger it (such as when the green flag is pressed) (I advise against this since you only need to open it once and not multiple times).
4. After you do this, a pop-up will appear (if the popup doesn't appear, check browser privacy settings).
5. Two tabs will appear: one called A.I chat and one called Scratch Block Translator, which is a GitHub project created by blob8108. You can find his repo [here](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks).
6. After clicking A.I chat, ask it anything about your code, and it'll help guide you to the answer. It'll output blocks which you can copy and paste into the Scratch Block Translator to see what they look like.
